# ST558_Project2
Project 2 for Data Science for Statisticians 

• Brief description of the app and its purpose.
  TBD (REPLACE ME)

• A list of packages needed to run the app.
 Packages needed:
  shiny
  tidyverse

• A line of code that would install all the packages used (so we can easily grab that and run it prior to running your app).
  Code to install necessary packages:
    install.packages(c("shiny","tidyverse"))

• The shiny::runGitHub() code that we can copy and paste into RStudio to run your app.
  Code to run the app:
    shiny::runGitHub("AHarvey37/ST558_Project2")
